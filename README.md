This repo demonstrates how to add authentication to a Svelte application using [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

It is a simple task list manager using the Svelte framework and Auth0. Users will be able to sign into this application to have authenticated access and create task items.

To see how to build this yourself, be sure to [check out the full tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/authenticating-svelte-apps).

## Get started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:auth0-blog/svelte-auth0.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd svelte-auth0
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
